    "4. You are allowed to work on the assignment in groups of 2 or 3 students and to submit together. Before you submit, you and your team members have to register as an **Assignment group** on Canvas. Only a single member of each group has to submit the notebook. Please do **NOT** submit the same notebook multiple times!\n",

    "The bias-variance decomposition/trade-off states that models with more complexity have a lower bias. However, this lowered bias comes at the expense of a higher variance. In this case, the weight of the second part of the Ridge regression minimisation criterion increases with a bigger $\\lambda$ (thus resulting in a more complex model).  \n",
    "\n",
    "From the left graph it may be concluded that the Root Mean Squared Error modereately decreases when lambda increases, which translates into a lower bias. Meanwhile, the right graph shows the relation between the values of the coefficients and the $\\lambda$'s. When $\\lambda$ is increased it pushes the coefficients towards zero, and simultanously the variance of these coefficient decomposes."

    "For $\\lambda =$ ```min_lambda``` the RMSE is the lowest. The one-standard-rule states that the least complex model whose CV error is no more than one standard deviation above the smallest error is selected. The chosen $\\lambda$ has a RMSE of ```min_RMSE``` and a std of ```min_RMSE_std```, which means the $\\lambda$ for which the model is the least complex within the one standard deviation is $\\lambda =$ ```OSE_lambda```."

Suppose you are asked to build a model for predicting *lpsa*, using **at most three features**. Which features would you choose? What is (approximately) the RMSE that we can expect from such a model?
